          A JAVASCRIPT ENGINE (there are mutiple)
          ___________________


is a programm that executes javascript code

- every browser has its owm javascript engine
- google chrome's js engine calls v-eight


ENGINE COMPONENTS AND HOW IT WORKS
__________________________________


every js engine contains a    CALL STACK                                 and a                   HEAP

                              is using "execution context"                                      unstructured memory pool, objects in memory
                              
                              execution context
                              
                              execution context             (single one after the other one will be executed)
                              
                              execution context
                              
                              where the code is executed                                        stores all the object which our programm needs
                              for callback-functions??





COMPILATION AND INTERPRETATION
______________________________  
          
          
Maschine Code 0010101010001111000101010010  

The processor CPU of a computer just understand maschine code


Compilation: Entire code is converted into maschine code at once, and written to a binary file that can be executed by a computer. (fast)


Interpretation: Interpreter runs trough the source code and executes it line by line. (slow)


Just-in-time (JIT) compilation: Entire code is converted into maschine code at once, then executed immediately.                   JAVASCRIPT (today)





          JAVASCRIPT RUNTIME
          __________________


                              OUTSIDE OF A BROWSER                                                                IN THE BROWSER

          node.js is a javascript runtime -> to run js outside of a browser                                 the browser is also a runtime
          has no (access to WEB APIs)                                                                       access to WEB APIs
          instead C++ BINDINGS & THREAD POOL (nice to know)


- without an engine there is no runtime
- we always need also access to the WEB APIs
- includes a "Callback-Queue" -> includes all the CALLBACK-FFUNCTIONS that are ready to be executed

Event-Handler-Functions -> are called Callback-Functions

as the event happens -> the callback function will be called -> the EVENT LOOP is doing this




          EXECUTION CONTEXT
          _________________
          
          
Whats inside Execution Context?
 
1. Variable Evironment
2. Scope Chain
3. this keyword               (not in arrow functions)
