          A JAVASCRIPT ENGINE (there are mutiple)
          ___________________


is a programm that executes javascript code

- every browser has its owm javascript engine
- google chrome's js engine calls v-eight


ENGINE COMPONENTS AND HOW IT WORKS
__________________________________


every js engine contains a    CALL STACK                                 and a                   HEAP

                              is using "execution context"                                      unstructured memory pool, objects in memory
                              where the code is executed                                        stores all the object which our programm needs






COMPILATION AND INTERPRETATION
______________________________  
          
          
Maschine Code 00010101010001111000101010010  

The processor CPU of a computer just understand maschine code


Compilation: Entire code is converted into maschine code at once, and written to a binary file that can be executed by a computer. (fast)


Interpretation: Interpreter runs trough the source code and executes it line by line. (slow)


Just-in-time (JIT) compilation: Entire code is converted into maschine code at once, then executed immediately.                   JAVASCRIPT (today)





          JAVASCRIPT RUNTIME
          __________________


                              OUTSIDE OF A BROWSER                                                                IN THE BROWSER

          node.js is a javascript runtime -> to run js outside of a browser                                 the browser is also a runtime



- without an engine there is no runtime
- we always need also access to the WEB APIs
